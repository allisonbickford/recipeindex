Easy Pumpkin Spice Latte


You may already be enjoying pumpkin spice lattes, but we’ve only just started craving them as the weather has finally cooled down and fall produce has begun popping up at the market. Swoon.
Is anyone else a sucker for fall? Chilly mornings, sunny afternoons, cozy food, good TV shows return. I mean, what’s not to love?
Let’s celebrate with a healthier, homemade take on pumpkin spice lattes. Yes, let’s.


This “PSL” is dreamy yet simple to make, requiring just 1 pot, simple ingredients, and 10 minutes to prepare.
It took quite a bit of testing to get it just right because spices are tricky to nail. In the process we even ended up making our own pumpkin pie spice recipe (!!), which we’ve been meaning to do for years since store-bought brands can vary so much and we wanted the flavor to be perfection.
However, in the recipe we also spell out individual spices just in case you don’t have any pumpkin pie spice on hand.
What’s in a Pumpkin Spice Latte?
In pumpkin spice lattes you’ll find at your average coffee shop (that aren’t super local and cute and organic), the ingredients can get a little dicey and often include natural flavors, carrageenan, and a lot of sugar. These aren’t things we necessarily avoid entirely, but do choose to limit whenever possible. Our homemade version includes real food ingredients like:

coconut milk
pumpkin purée
maple syrup
vanilla extract
spices (like cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger)
& espresso or your coffee of choice

Caffeine-Free Option (Dandy Blend!)
Because we’ve been digging caffeine-free / low-caffeine drinks lately, we included a caffeine-free option too!
Have you ever tried Dandy Blend? It’s an herbal alternative to coffee that smells and tastes like coffee and is made of extracts of barley, rye, dandelion, and chicory. Somehow the gluten is (magically) removed during the extraction process, making it gluten-free to boot.
We’d heard it recommended in the health community for a while but had more or less written it off as “not as good as the real thing.” But upon sampling it recently, we were so impressed we bought a bag and have been using it in things like this drink and afternoon “lattes.” Caffeine-free “coffee” for the win.

How to Make a Pumpkin Spice Latte
Making the latte is the easy part.
Simply add all of your ingredients to a small saucepan and whisk to combine. Heat until just bubbling over medium heat, then add coffee of choice and stir. That’s it!
You can also make an iced version by adding all the ingredients to a glass jar and stirring to combine. Then add some ice and shake vigorously for 30 seconds until completely combined. Bam: iced PSL.
Simply top with coconut whipped cream or a dash of nutmeg or cinnamon and dive into this comforting fall beverage.

We hope you LOVE this latte! It’s:
Fall-inspired
Pumpkin-infused
Perfectly spiced
Naturally sweetened
Customizable
& Incredibly delicious
This would make the perfect drink to cozy up to after a long day this fall or winter. It’s not only easy to make, but also health promoting thanks to spices like ginger, clove, and cinnamon, which can have digestive, anti-inflammatory, and blood sugar-balancing benefits.

Does it keep?

					2-3 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 


3/4
cup
dairy-free milk 
(we recommend cashew milk, but coconut or hemp milk would also work well)


1/4
cup
water


2-3
Tbsp
pumpkin purée 
(not pumpkin pie mix)


1/2
heaping tsp
ground cinnamon 
(*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)


1/4
tsp
ground ginger
(*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)


1
healthy pinch
ground nutmeg
(*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)


1
healthy pinch
ground allspice
(*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)


1
healthy pinch
ground clove 
(*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)


1
healthy pinch
 ground cardamom
(optional // *if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)


1/8
tsp
freshly ground black pepper


1 ½ - 2
tsp
maple syrup, more or less to taste 
(or sub stevia to taste)


1
shot
espresso 
(or sub 1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, or 1 ½ -2 tsp Dandy Blend for caffeine-free option)


1/2
tsp
vanilla extract




FOR SERVING optional


Coconut whipped cream


Pumpkin pie spice





Instructions



If adding coffee or espresso, prepare at this time and set aside.




HOT VERSION


To a small saucepan, add dairy-free milk and water. Bring to a simmer, then add pumpkin purée, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, clove, cardamom (optional), black pepper, and maple syrup. Whisk until smooth. Note: A little separation is natural with both the pumpkin and dairy-free milk, so whisk/stir as needed to smooth.


Add coffee, espresso, or dandy blend and vanilla and whisk until smooth.


Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more spices to taste, espresso coffee or dandy blend for stronger coffee flavor, or maple syrup for sweetness.




ICED VERSION


Add all ingredients to a jar with a lid and stir to combine. Then add ice, secure lid, and shake vigorously to combine — about 30 seconds.




FOR SERVING


Serve as is, or top with coconut whipped cream and a pinch of pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, or nutmeg.


Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 1 week. Because of the pumpkin purée and dairy-free milk, separation is natural. Simply stir before serving or whisk when reheating on the stovetop.






 

Notes
*If you’re using pumpkin pie spice, start with 1/2 tsp of the mixture and work your way up as spice blends / intensities may vary.*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated with the lesser amount of pumpkin purée and maple syrup and without optional ingredients.

I made it in my Vitamix with almond milk, fresh pumpkin that I had just roasted, and your recipe for pumpkin spice blend .  I LOVED it as it wasn’t overly sweet.
I would suggest if using fresh pumpkin to use only 2tbsp. And I also agree that a  1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice is enough -you can always add more if you like.  After is was all blended I just heated it briefly on the stovetop

I really like the idea of a homemade pumpkin spice latte and the flavor was good so I’m going to try again and tweak it a little. My cashew milk was pretty thick and I used closer to three tablespoons of pumpkin, so my latte was too thick for my taste and not quite sweet enough. I might try two tablespoons of pumpkin instead, less spices, almond milk instead of cashew, and a different kind of sugar. But, I’m excited to try again.

Those modifications should help with the thickness. Let us know how it goes the second time around!

My first post ever!  I tried this for the first time and used chicory (caffeine free coffee alternative) instead of coffee.  it really tasted very nice.  I blended it all at the end with a hand blender which made it silky smooth.  It tasted really nice. Extremely intense flavour. Reminded me almost of chai tea. But the pumpkin flavour really shone thru. Probably because I let the pumpkin really simmer and start caramelizing which really boosted that pumpkin flavour. All in all, a very nice recipe. Will definitely try it again during winter!

If you’re a fan of Dandy Blend you should check out Mellow Rooster. They make a similar product (caffeine free chicory coffee) that’s made with whole herbs/spices  that you brew up just like coffee or loose leaf tea. It’s obviously less convenient than instant dandy, but I think it’s a little more complex tasting, and I really love it! Oh, and this latte was absolutely perfect made with Mellow Rooster!

I made this per instructions using  coconut milk, 1/2 tsp. Simply Organic Pumpkin Pie Spice, and a stovetop espresso maker. I found it  a  *PERFECTLY* balanced blend of peppery pumpkin; the generous serving size was a plus! Thank you! :-)

A little too much pepper for my taste, next time I would half it.  I used organic whole milk And store bought pumpkin pie spice and it all turned out lovely. Thanks Dana for kicking off my fall happy spirit.

Yum!  I added a little extra maple syrup and sugar free vanilla syrup.  Then I added Rumchata!  Ahhhh.  Inspired. Love it. Thanks for the recipe?

I used milkadamia unsweetened macadamia milk. Would recommend skipping the water, mine came out watery. But flavors are great. Will tinker with it and make again. Thank you.

Thanks for sharing, Anna! Yes, because of the pumpkin purée I recommend a lighter milk so it doesn’t get too thick. But it sounds like you can skip the water next time and just add all milk!

I’ve been making this (almost exact!) recipe for a couple weeks now and love that your version just popped up. I also use Dandy Blend for caffeine free and I love using oat milk for a super creamy version. I also usually add a couple tsp coconut oil and melt that in for extra benefits :)

Do you have (or know of) a PSL recipe that doesn’t use coffee or coffee-tasting ingredients? I really don’t like the taste of coffee… but I love pumpkin. I’ve always wanted to drink it (instead of making pumpkin things or spooning it into my morning oatmeal…).
Thanks!
And thanks for all the amazing recipes. I almost forgot to say that!

I say omit the coffee! It’ll still be delicious. Or sub black tea!

I made a version using a mix of jasmine and earl grey tea. I also saw someone made it using chai tea for double the spice . So you can definitely go with tea :)

In your testing, did you try brewing the spices with the coffee to compare how the flavor developed? Just curious. I typically brew my spices with my coffee and like it but was wondering if that was something you explored before settling on this method. Excited to try it!
