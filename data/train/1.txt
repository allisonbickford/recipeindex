Miso-Glazed Roasted Brussels Sprouts



If you’ve been looking for a quick, reliable way to make crispy roasted Brussels sprouts, you’re in the right place!
We’ve perfected our method for tender-on-the-inside, crispy-on-the-outside sprouts plus a tangy, salty glaze that sends the flavor over the top. Let’s do this!



This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 8 ingredients to make.
The Trick to Crispy Brussels Sprouts
Halved, seasoned Brussels sprouts cook first on the stovetop, then finish in the oven.The trick is getting a “sear” on the sprouts on the stovetop first (preferably in a cast iron pan) before transferring to a very hot oven to roast at a high temp.The other trick is not crowding the pan (a large cast iron is best). Crowding doesn’t allow a proper sear and creates steam, which ultimately makes for soggier Brussels sprouts.

While your Brussels sprouts and garlic are finishing in the oven, make your glaze.
This one is inspired by a few restaurant versions I’ve tried that mock salt and vinegar chips. For a similar effect I created a glaze with:
miso (chickpea miso for soy-free)rice vinegar (or apple cider or white wine vinegar)sea saltmaple syrup (or raw honey)
The result is a light glaze that’s equal parts salty, sweet, and acidic, which coats the sprouts right out of the oven for an additional burst of flavor.

What flavor profile do Brussels Sprouts have when roasted?
Brussels sprouts that are roasted take on a slightly sweet, caramelized flavor. They also become crisp on the outside to provide a nice crunchy exterior.
The reason we prefer sautéing on the stovetop before roasting is to get that nice browned, crispy edge, which is only enhanced as it roasts in the oven.

We hope you LOVE these Brussels sprouts. They’re:
Crispy on the outsideTender on the insideHeartyFlavorfulSalty-sweetCustomizable& SO delicious
These would make a delicious side for holiday gatherings and beyond. We could also see them pairing well with our Vegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf,” Easy Marinated Grilled Chicken, or Lemon Baked Salmon with Garlic Dill Sauce.

Does it keep?

					2-3 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
BRUSSELS


5
cups
Brussels sprouts, browned outer leaves removed, large stalks trimmed off, halved
(quartered if very large in size // 1 lb yields ~5 cups)


2
tsp
avocado oil 
(or other neutral-flavored cooking fat that can withstand high heat)


3/4
tsp
sea salt, plus more to taste


1/4
tsp
fresh black pepper


5
whole cloves
garlic, skin removed and smashed or halved




MISO GLAZE


1
Tbsp
miso paste 
(we prefer chickpea miso for a soy-free option — Miso Master is a great brand // always ensure gluten-free friendly as needed)


2
Tbsp
rice vinegar 
(or sub apple cider or white wine vinegar)


1
Tbsp
maple syrup


1
pinch
sea salt




FOR COOKING


2
Tbsp
avocado oil 
(or other neutral-flavored cooking fat that can withstand high heat)





Instructions



Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).


Add trimmed and halved Brussels sprouts to a large mixing bowl (reserve garlic cloves for later use) and season with oil, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat and set aside.


In a separate small mixing bowl, add the miso glaze ingredients and stir / whisk to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt or miso for saltiness, vinegar for acidity, or maple syrup for sweetness. It should be equal parts tangy, salty, and sweet. Set aside for later use.


Heat a large (at least 12-inch) oven-safe skillet (we prefer cast iron) over medium-high heat. Once hot, add cooking oil (it should coat the bottom of the pan, so add more as needed).


Wait 1 minute for the oil to heat, then add Brussels sprouts (NOT THE GLAZE — we’ll use that later). Make sure the pan is not crowded — all sprouts should have room to lie face down and they shouldn’t be piled on top of each other. If it’s crowded, remove a few to cook in a separate batch.


Cook for 2-3 minutes cut side down to get a sear. Once golden brown, add garlic, toss, and transfer to oven.


Bake for 10-15 minutes, removing from the oven every 5 minutes to toss and inspect the sprouts. You want them crispy and deep golden brown but not burnt.


Remove from oven and immediately add HALF the miso glaze (alternatively, reserve all as a dipping sauce). Toss to coat and serve hot with remaining glaze on the side for dipping.


Best when fresh. Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Not freezer friendly. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop in a skillet over medium heat until hot.

These Brussels sprouts are delicious!  I did not have a cast iron pan, but the stovetop/oven cooking method still produced a crispy outside and tender inside. The glaze is tasty and intense.  I used 2 tablespoons, but I think only 1-1.5 is enough.  I will definitely make these again.

Hi Dana! I made this yesterday and loved it! The Miso sauce/glaze is amazing! I liked it so much that I put ALL the sauce on the brussel sprouts and tossed everything together! I think it’s an absolutely brilliant idea to cook the brussel sprouts both on the stove and in the oven!

I don’t have a cast iron pan so did stove portion in regular skillet and then switched to a baking pan for the oven portion. I do suspect they would have been even better in a cast iron as there would have been more of a minarating effect. But whatever, they turned out great anyway. What puts this receipe over the top and into the A+ zone is the heckin miso glaze. God bless!

Hello! I’m trying to cook everything wfpbno, and wanted to ask the right way of trying this Brussels sprouts recipe without any oil. Your thoughts and guidance are appreciated. Thanks, Andrew

Hi Andrew, unfortunately the sprouts won’t get as crispy without oil. BUT you can employ this method and add the glaze near the end of roasting for a similar effect.

Love roasted Brussels — thanks for encouraging all those soggy Brussels sprout survivors to give them another try! My cheat on your method for that combo of crisp exterior plus soft interior—(stove top is too much work…) is to place the halves down on a greased cookie sheet then roast on the lowest oven rack until brown.  Then proceed with the rest of your recipe.  Also, the smell??!! After much research, my best solution is baking soda— I spread it in the oven while roasting, either on the oven mat or in a dish in the back of the  Any other successful methods for sulfur stink? I’ve tried lemons in the oven, boiling lemons or vinegar in the stove, open baking soda in the kitchen… I often cook while my family is sleeping and feel guilty giving them nightmares !

Please advise:  Will this recipe work with frozen brussel sprouts?
It looks wonderful!  Your offerings are always spectacular!

Hmm, I fear they would become too soggy because of the extra moisture. Let us know how it goes if you give it a try!

Never found success with frozen Brussels —vegetables  with a lot of water tend to lose their structure when frozen —great for purées, not for roasting

Tasted great! Super easy and quick. I added it to a bed of quinoa and poured the glaze over the whole dish, delicious!

We made these Brussels last night and they were delicious. I was skeptical about the miso paste I whipped up because I didn’t love the taste before putting them on the sprouts, but I poured it on regardless and it was *insert chef’s kiss*. Thank you for another great recipe! So easy to make and the browsing the sprouts in the cast iron is definitely a pivotal step.

I can’t have vinegars or acidic foods. What ingredient can I use?

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

I assume that means no lemon? Perhaps just try leaving it out or subbing water or coconut aminos.

Dear Dana,
Can you do this with frozen brussel sprouts?

We think so, but do suspect it could make the Brussels a little bit soggy. But if you do try it let us know how it goes!
